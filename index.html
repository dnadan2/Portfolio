      <h1>Hi There!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio, a collection of programs I have made entirely or played a substancial part in making. Some of these projects have been released, some were completed but never released, some are still ongoing and some are incomplete. Incomplete programs are not included unless they were far enough into development. 
      <br><br>
      If you would like to see any of the following programs running don't hesitate to contact me. Most still run on my laptop so at worst I can provide a screen capture video, for JavaScript programs I can host a local server but for others only a few were packaged into installables. 
      <br><br>
      Github, Bit Bucket and the university's SVN repository are my most used repositories. I have put links to my profiles on the bottom left of the page, however most repositories on these are private and I cannot link to the university's repository.
