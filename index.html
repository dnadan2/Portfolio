      <h1>Hi There!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio, a collection of programs I have made entirely or played a substancial part in making. Some of these projects have been released, some were completed but never released and some, often because university or some other more important project came around, are incomplete. These are here for completeness. For a display of websites i have made visit <a href="www.websites.danblessettwilliams.com">websites</a>.</p>

          <h2>Cow Drop</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText"> Cow drop was designed to be a mobile game, but due to being programmed in Javascript it is also playable online. The full version can be found either on Google Play Store <a href="https://goo.gl/Loiqkl">here</a> or on Kongregate <a href="https://goo.gl/XctmMT">here</a>. It was programmed in one week with one other person.

          <h2>Detecting Cells</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">In a Second year module, using this image and several others as training a program was created that could, as accuretly as possible, outline the edges of the cells. The focus of this module was testing combinations of edge detection methods(guassian, laplacian, hough transform etc), noise removal, greyscaling and thresholding to find the optimal edge map after ROC analysis.

          <h2>Untitled Space Game</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">This is a newly started game. It is intended to be released on steam. It is a strategy game set in space, each player will build off of planets, asteroids, space stations in order to advance technology, money and military in order to beat the other players. It is 3D on a hexagon grid. At the moment the game engine is nearing completion, created with one other person.

          <h2>Bleak - Story Creator</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText"> This goes hand in hand with the Bleak game. It is a tool to create your own interactive story. While it has yet to be made graphically pleasing most of the functionality is there. You can make any story node, it can have pretext, posttext, a photo, change inventory items or player statistics. it can be Exported into a .story file. Most can be changed and updated in a node panel additionally choices can be connected by dragging and dropping arrows. In the future the UI will be improved and Import will work, animations will also be accepted or preset ones can be added, created with one other persons.

          <h2>Bleak</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText"> This is an interactive story game, given a scenario the user gets to chose one of multiple choices to take different arcs in the story. Each part of the story comes with an image. In the future the game will display the inventory throughout the game as well as animated acompanying pictures. While this is relativly simple to code it has not yet been completed largely due to the story creator being incomplete.

          <h2>Isometric</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">In a 36 hour Hackathon in Barcelona me and two others created this. It is an educational game aimed to help teach younger people to code filled with sounds animations and basic graphics. In it you controled a player via a code window on the side. It consisted of 2 levels and a boss level to show more advanced possibilities. This boss level required coding a binary search.

          <h2>CryptoVision</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">CryptoVision was a Team project assigned by the university, the only specification being it had to be a visualisation. We developed an educational tool to help A level and First year university students to understand 3 different encryption algorithms. It did this by step by step converting pixels of a chosen image into encrypted colours. It went through each step explaining what happened. These steps could be sped up, slowed down, paused, skipped, etc.

          <p class = "portfolioText">Mathformer was made for my A2 Computing program it was the first large scale program I made. It was an educational game to teach maths. This game was effectively a 2D physics engine with an SQL database backend. The studentsand teachers could create accounts and log in, the students would be greeted by a 2D platformer game in which they had to collect numbers and operators scattered around the level to take them to the door and place them in the right places to make the equation true. The teacher would be able to see the back end databse to see their progress.
