      <h1>Hi There!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio, a collection of programs I have made entirely or played a substancial part in making. Some of these projects have been released, some were completed but never released, some are still ongoing and some are incomplete. Most incomplete programs are not included. 
      <br><br>
      If you would like to see any of the following running don't hesitate to contact me. Most still run on my laptop so at worst I can provide a screen capture video, for JavaScript ones I can host a local server but for others only some were packaged into installables. 
      <br><br>
      Github, Bit Bucket and the university's SVN repository are my most used repositories. I have put links to my profiles on the bottom left of the page, however most repositories on these are private. I cannot link to the university's repository.
      <br><br>

          <h2>CryptoVision</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">CryptoVision was a Team project assigned by the university, the only specification being it had to be a visualisation. We developed an educational tool to help A level and First year university students to understand 3 different encryption algorithms. It did this by step by step converting pixels of a chosen image into encrypted colours. It went through each step explaining what happened. These steps could be sped up, slowed down, paused, skipped, etc.

          <h2>Robotic Waiter</h2>
          <p class = "portfolioText">In a university module we were given a robot. After considering multiple functions for the robot we rigged it with a  telescope tripod, a kenect camera fixed on a lego mount to give us sensors in addition to the laser and sonar build into the base of the robot. The laser was used to avoid crashes and the kenect was used for head detection in order to detect people. We used the ROS navstack, an amcl algorithm, to navigate from place to place. The map was generated using SLAM. With these tools we aimed to make a robotic waiter so we developed a hierarchical task planning module to prioritise functions like serving assigning table to new customers getting food from the kitchen etc. The robot also had a UI for choosing meals, and could use text to voice to communicate. The University of Birmingham is currently hosting our website from the module <a href = "http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/courses/int-robot/halloffame/2016/Leslie/">here</a>

In this 24 hour hackathon we made a virtual house for this purpose. Using the occulous rift you could move around the house placing images of any object wherever you wanted(option to upload your own). While we originally had intentions for a whole house we had a lot of trouble getting the oculous rift package to work with our other code and so by the end only had this one room

The teacher would be able to see the back end databse to see their progress.
